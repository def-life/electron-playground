electron app is made up of 2 processs
main process which run in nodejs environment and therefore has access to the nodejs api aka privileged operations
renderere process which runs in chromium environment has dom and other browser stuff
main process run nodejs stuff
renderer process run browserwindow.

ONe tricky part is 
rendere process has two parts 
preload scripts and entrypoint for ui
both are connected via contextbridge
also preload has access to ipc channel 
so both main and renderer can now talk via this channel.
